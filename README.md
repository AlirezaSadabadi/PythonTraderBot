How to implement a **trading bot** with Python?

Is this simple? **yes**

In this repository, there is a robot code that can easily take the information of candles and the list of positions and trade with the desired strategies.
The robot uses Metatrader software, However, if you want to work with a specific exchange, this goal can be achieved just by changing the _Meta_ class.
The working method and tutorials related to these codes and strategies are on my YouTube channel (https://youtube.com/@alirezasadabadi?si=d8o7LK_Ai1Hf68is).
Of course in Persian. But with the new feature of YouTube, you can watch videos with supported subtitles such as english.
