How to implement a **trading bot** with Python?

Is this simple? **yes**

In this repository, a trading robot can easily take the information on candles and the list of positions and trade with the desired strategies.
The robot uses Metatrader software. However, if you want to work with a specific exchange, you can achieve this goal just by changing the _Meta_ class.
The working method and tutorials related to these codes and strategies are on my YouTube channel (https://youtube.com/@alirezasadabadi?si=d8o7LK_Ai1Hf68is).
Of course in Persian. But with the new feature of YouTube, you can watch videos with supported subtitles such as English.

The Meta class is in another repository https://github.com/AlirezaSadabadi/PythonTraderBotMeta
